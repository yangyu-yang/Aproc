/**
 * @brief Initialize Compander module
 * @param ct Pointer to a CompanderContext object.
 * @param num_channels Number of channels. 
 * @param sample_rate Sample rate.
 * @param threshold The threshold determines the input level at which the compander will activate. 
 *        This happens when the signal is loud enough to cross this threshold level (upward expansion or downward compression) or 
 *        quiet enough to fall below it (downward expansion or upward compression).
 *        Set the threshold in step of 0.01dB. Allowable range: -9000 ~ 0 to cover -90.00dB ~ 0.00dB. For example, -2550 stands for -25.50dB threshold.
 * @param ratio_below  The output/input ratio in step of 0.01 when the input level is below the threshold.
 *        Range: 1 ~ 10000 to cover real ratio from 0.01 ~ 100.00.
 *        Assuming a hard knee characteristic and a steady-state input, the ratio is defined as R=(y−T)/(x−T)
 *        where R is the ratio. y is the output signal in dB. x is the input signal in dB. T is the threshold in dB.
 *        When R>1.00, i.e. ratio_below>100, the signals below threshold get quieter (downward expander).
 *        When R<1.00, i.e. ratio_below<100, the signals below threshold get louder (upward compressor).
 *        When R=1.00, i.e. ratio_below=100, the signals below threshold keep unchanged.
 * @param ratio_above  The input/output ratio in step of 0.01 when the input level is above the threshold.
 *        Range: 1 ~ 10000 to cover real ratio from 0.01 ~ 100.00.
 *        Assuming a hard knee characteristic and a steady-state input, the ratio is defined as R=(x−T)/(y−T)
 *        where R is the ratio. y is the output signal in dB. x is the input signal in dB. T is the threshold in dB.
 *        When R>1.00, i.e. ratio_above>100, the signals above threshold get quieter (downward compressor).
 *        When R<1.00, i.e. ratio_above<100, the signals above threshold get louder (upward expander).
 *        When R=1.00, i.e. ratio_above=100, the signals above threshold keep unchanged.
 * @param attack_time Amount of time (in millisecond) the compander will go from zero to full compression or from full to zero expansion.
 * @param release_time Amount of time (in millisecond) the compander will go from full to zero compression or from zero to full expansion.
 * @return error code. COMPANDER_ERROR_OK means successful, other codes indicate error.
