/**
 * @brief Initialize the engine sound module
 * @param ct Pointer to an EngineSoundContext object.
 * @param sample_rate Sample rate.
 * @param rpm_min RPM (Round Per Minute) value when the engine is in idle state. 700 is a recommended value. Range: 500 <= rpm_min < 1000
 * @param rpm_max RPM (Round Per Minute) value when the engine is running at the maximum speed. e.g. 5000. This value should be in thousands, more than rpm_min and >= 1000.
 * @param n Number of samples to process in each loop. This value should be in range [128, MAX_W_SIZE/2] and affects both the CPU consumption and the simulation performance.
 * @param cb Callback function that is able to read n PCM samples from a specified sound source.
 * @param startup_sound_required Whether engine startup sound is required. 0:not required, 1:required. If engine startup sound is required, it is played once only at the initial stage.
 * @return error code. ENGINESOUND_ERROR_OK means successful, other codes indicate error. 
 * @note Upon successful initialization, the engine's RPM is set at rpm_min. The user is responsible to provide the sound at each thousand RPM level.
 * For example, if rpm_min is set at 700 and rpm_max at 5000, the callback function will try to read one from the 6 sound sources, i.e.
 * sounds of engine speed at 700, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 & 5000 RPM respectively. If engine startup sound is required(startup_sound_required=1), the callback
 * function will try to read engine startup sound(sound_idx=-1) at the initial stage (only once). Please notice that the sound of engine at idle state will 
 * be played right after the engine startup sound. So make sure these two sound clips can be smoothly played, otherwise abrupt noise or distortion can be
 * heard due to the discontinuity between two clips if occured. Except the engine startup sound, other sound clips will be played in loop. So make sure these 
 * sound clips can be continuously played from the end of clip end back to the start of the clip itself.
